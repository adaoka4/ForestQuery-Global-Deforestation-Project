# ForestQuery-Global-Deforestation-Project
Exploratory analysis of deforestation data using SQL


ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

My goal was to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes. The analysis included a global overview, analysis by regions, country-level details, success stories, areas with the greatest concerns, distribution of countries based on quartiles and lastly, recommendations.
